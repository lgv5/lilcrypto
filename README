Experiment on rolling my own crypto. Kinda. I'm not creating any new
protocol, but implementing known algorithms and constructions. The main
focus is to understand how to implement the math behind the algorithms,
and to get to know the constructions better.

Algorithms
==========

Utilities
---------

- Constant-time operations
  - [/] compare: returns `0` if match, non-`0` otherwise. The non-`0`
    case might leak information. Would be better to return `0xffffffff`
    if match, `0` otherwise.

Hash
----

- [x] SHA-384
- [x] SHA-512 (needed for Ed25519)

Authentication
--------------

- [x] Poly1305

Ciphers
-------

- [x] ChaCha20
- [ ] XChaCha20

AEAD
----

- [x] ChaCha20-Poly1305
- [ ] XChaCha20-Poly1305

ECC
---

- Curve25519
  - [ ] Ed25519 (EdDSA)
  - [ ] X25519 (ECDH)

Nice-to-haves
=============

Utilities
---------

- [ ] Portable Makefile
- [ ] NaCl interface
- [ ] signify interface

Hash
----

- [ ] SHA-256 & SHA-224 (the latter is a truncated form of the former)
- [ ] SHA-512/224 & SHA-512/256 (most of the work done)

Authentication
--------------

- [ ] GMAC

Ciphers
-------

- [ ] AES
- [ ] Camellia
- [ ] Salsa20 (no Wycheproof test vector suite)
- [ ] XSalsa20 (no Wycheproof test vector suite)

AEAD
----

- [ ] AES-GCM
- [ ] Camellia-GCM
- [ ] Salsa20-Poly1305 (no Wycherproof test vector suite)
- [ ] XSalsa20-Poly1305 (no Wycherproof test vector suite)

KDF?
